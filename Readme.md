# Video Recommendation System

This project implements a recommendation system for the Socialverse platform using a hybrid approach that combines **content-based** and **collaborative** filtering methods. It utilizes user interactions, post features, and mood-based filtering to generate personalized recommendations for users. 


## ðŸŽ¯ Project Overview

This project implements a video recommendation algorithm that:

- Delivers personalized content recommendations
- Handles cold start problems using mood-based recommendations
- Utilizes deep neural networks for content analysis
- Integrates with external APIs for data collection
- Implements efficient data caching and pagination

## Running the Project

To run the project locally, follow the steps below:

### 1. Install Dependencies

Ensure you have Python 3.x installed, then install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Start the Flask Application

Run the application using the following command:
```bash
python3 app.py
```
This will start the Flask server on `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.

### 3. Access the API

Once the application is running, you can interact with the API by sending a request to the /feed endpoint with the desired parameters.
